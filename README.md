going to / will
Quando usar o will, não pode ser algo que ocorrerá muito logo ou será abordado no próximo paragráfo.
Exemplo:
We will set it later. (espera-se que isso será definido mais tarde ou mais para frente)
We're going to set it. (espera-se que isso será definido em seguida, no próximo pagrafo/sessão/capítulo)

-- As palavras NOW e WILL dificilmente estarã na mesma frase. No exemplo a seguir é dito que AGORA, neste exato momento, nós FAREMOS algo no futuro, em algum momento indefinido. Isso gera uma inconsistência temporal.
   Now, we will do something.

by/through



Through generally indicates transit from one end of something to another (often, but not always, the opposite end). This can involve literal passage through space or time ("We drove through Texas", "I waited through the night"), or figurative movement through a system or process ("Your request is still making its way through the bureaucracy").

By as a preposition has many definitions; the ones that interest us all loosely boil down to "using the means, mechanism, or agency of." If means or mechanism don't sound very different from system or process to you, don't feel bad. These are two of the more difficult prepositions to get right, and sometimes there is no right answer and you just use the one that feels right (or less wrong, anyway). Writers and editors argue over this and related matters all the time.

As a very general rule of thumb, if literal or figurative motion or progression is involved, use through. Otherwise, use by. There are tons of exceptions, however, and sometimes you just use whichever preposition is most conventionally used with the word or phrase, without asking questions.

To look at your examples specifically:

 - My house is heated **by**/through gas. (Gas is the means used to heat your house.)
 - I'll pay you **by**/through check. (A check is the mechanism you use to pay.)
 - I learned that by/**through** a lot of practice. (Practice is a process, and you progressed through it from the point at which you did not possess the skill to the point at which you did.)
 - Success only happens by/**through** hard work. (Hard work is a process, etc.)
 - The tickets are available by/**through** the Internet. ("Through" is a bit of an evolved convention here. Think of the Internet in the popular 1990s-era conception of a virtual realm through which you travel to your destination.)

Those are the easy ones. The other two are harder:

 - I'll send it to you by/through mail. (This depends on whether you consider "mail" to be a mechanism or a system. Generally, I would either use by mail or through the mail, with the idea that "mail" is a mechanism, but "the mail" refers to the postal system.)
 
       I'll send it to you by mail.
       I'll send it to you through [the] mail.

 - Through/by including a warning prompt prior to asking a SA related question, SPAM probes have been thought to isolate workload from the assessment of SA. (ugh, this is just an ugly sentence to begin with; I'd use by including or through the inclusion of, with similar reasoning to the above.)



The summary:

    use "by" when "through" does not work
    if "through" has a specialized definition for that case, use "through"
    otherwise, use "by" when focusing on the method; use "through" when focusing on the end result
